Assignment 2 comments:

Question 1: Algorithms. 10/10

Question 2:

eq: 5/5

goal: 5/5

BFS/DFS: 5/5

DLS: 7/10 - you're incrementing depth each time you dequeue, which will yield
an inaccurate result. Better to make it a member variable and then 
depth=parent.depth + 1

tools: 10/10

decomposition: 10/10

Question 3:

read_mars_graph: 5/5

A*: 15/15

count states: 5/5

Question 4: 0/10 - I don't see this part.

Question 5: 10/10 - AlphaZero also learns an extremely accurate heuristic
function.

87/100
